# HOW TO USE #
# ********** #

	- Customize (if necessary) interface configurations by changing config/config.json file
	- Customize (if necessary) interface styles by changing config/custom-style.css
	- Open index.html in a browser that allow file access from files (e.g. Firefox, Safari, IE)
	   
	   If you want to use it with Google Chrome, you need to deactivate protection; for example, in MAC OSx 
	   open the terminal, write *PATH_TO_CHROME_APP* --allow-file-access-from-files; and press enter.
	   (Note that *PATH_TO_CHROME_APP* must be the actual path to your Chrome application).

	- Enjoy...
